  # TODOS: Add ATP cell cluster, code a JellidSystem and Component that basically uses similar to borgchassis code, where it displays the power percentage on the player's UI. Make a unique damage event though if battery is empty.
  #        Ideally the battery shouldn't have a OnRemoved event, because that'd mean that the Jellid is almost certainly gibbed and already dead beyond repair.
