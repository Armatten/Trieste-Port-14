  So sombody is really hurt? Lets do something about that!

  # What are Proteins?

  Proteins are a special type of medication that has some unique properties

  1. They last a long time
  
  2. In the right circumstances, they can heal extremely quickly
  
  3. How effective they are is based upon body temp

  ## How to get them

  Proteins are primarily created by re-activating denatured proteins
  
  To get denatured proteins, you need to overheat some medications.
  
  The easist way to get them would be to heat up blood or inaprovaline

  ## What to do with them

  So you have the denatured proteins? Cool! Time to make them useful

  To start, you want to run them through the centrifuge, which will break it down into dormant protiens and some assorted basic elements

  Then, take these dormant proteins, give them some food, carbon, and oxygen, then throw them in an incubator, which will make activated proteins (More ways to get these will come in the future!!!)

  ## Now what?

  Currently, there are 2 main ways to specialise the proteins

  You can make either

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="HyperPlatelet"/>

  or

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="HyperMarrow"/>

  Platelets deal with brute damage, while marrow deals with burn
  
  Both of them heal all of said damage type, but with a very large booste depending on body temp
  
  You can check the chemical guidebook to see exactly what the temps are
  
  To get the correct temperatures, use

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Calordine"/>
  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Cryodine"/>

  (There is also a non-protein med that functions like this, made by combining lepo and lepa)

  ## Anything else?

  Proteins can also be used to hyper-oxygenate saline, allowing it to deal with both bloodloss and asphyxiation

  Also, dont mix the two protiens, or you will have to pull out the third protein specialization
