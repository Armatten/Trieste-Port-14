So sombody is really hurt? Lets do something about that!

# Temperature Based Treatment

<GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Lexodine"/>
<GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="HyperPlatelet"/>
<GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="HyperMarrow"/>

These three meds heal all of their associated damage, but temperature augments them
The two hyper ones are protein based, while the Lexodine is a standard med

Lexodine heals burn, cold, and shock.

Cold when the body temp is hot
Shock when the body temp is average
and Heat while the body temp is cold

Hyper Marrow also treats burns, but not as quick
However, it has the same temperature modulation, lasts far longer, and can also treat caustic!

Hyper Platelets function the same, but with Blunt, Pierce, and Slash

Do avoid mixing the two Hyper Proteins, however, as that can desabilise the paitents genome!

If that happens, you might want to use some
