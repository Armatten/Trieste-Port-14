  # The Storm Array

  The storm array siphons energy from the lighting above Trieste.

  It's a relatively simple machine, producing energy at a near constant rate in exchange for heat.
  The room the Storm Array is kept in MUST be kept cool, or it will begin degrading and eventually melt down and explode.

  # Procedures

  The storm array's cooling machinery must be kept on at all times, providing a safe environment for it to channel the electricity.
  Do not touch the array without gloves, as it is highly charged and will electrocute anyone who comes in contact with it.
