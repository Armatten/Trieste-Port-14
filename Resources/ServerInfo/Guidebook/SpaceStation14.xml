# Trieste Info

   Trieste Port is very different from other SS14 servers, both in setting and mechanics.
   Check out the Lore page for the story and lore of the server.

   Trieste Port takes place on an old ex-NT oil rig, on a ocean world in the outer rim. You play as Anti-NT settlers who have made this settlement as a free port from Megacorporations.

# What's New?

   Trieste has a few new mechanics you should be aware of:

   - Falling: If you step off the platform or throw something off, it will fall into the Waste Zone below. Go south if you fall, there's a ladder you can climb to go back up.
   - Cold Air: Trieste (the platform) is very cold. Wear a jacket if you're outside for a long time, and turn on the heaters inside buildings to keep them toasty.
   - The Diving Bell: The map is separated in two main sections: Trieste and Sweetwater
